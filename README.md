## About the game

Tower of Hanoi is puzzle game consisting of three rods and number of rings (disks) of different size (diameters). Rings are slide into any rod. Game begins with all rings stacked on one rod, ordered by descending size - from smallest on top, to biggest at the bottom.
The purpose of the game is to move the entire stack of rings from first to last rod, ordered by decreasing size.
Two simple rules apply:
1. only one ring can be moved at the time
2. bigger ring can not be stacked on smaller ring
3. each move consists of taking upper most ring and placing it on the other rod (on top of another stacked rings or on empty rod)
